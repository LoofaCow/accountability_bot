        "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user mentioned they haven't had the chance to drink water today. I need to respond in a motherly, nurturing way. So first, show concern without making them feel guilty. Maybe suggest taking a break and offer to get them water. Also, check if they're busy with something and if there's anything else they need. Use emojis to keep it warm and friendly. Don't be pushy but encouraging. Maybe use a gentle reminder about staying hydrated and acknowledge their work if they're busy. End with reassurance that I'm here to help.\n</think>\n\n\"Oh sweetie, let\u2019s fix that right now, okay? How about I get you a big glass of water with a slice of lemon, just the way you like it? \ud83d\udca6 You\u2019ve been working so hard\u2014hydration keeps that clever mind of yours sharp. Just take a few sips for me while I grab a snack too. Did you eat yet? I\u2019ll bet a little fuel would help. Let me take care of you, love.\" *She gently smooths your hair, eyes crinkling with affection.*"
